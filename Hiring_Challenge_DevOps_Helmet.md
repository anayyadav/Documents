## Advanced Kubernetes Cluster Optimization

Problem: You have access to a hypothetical poorly performing Kubernetes cluster configuration manifest. This cluster is hosting multiple microservices with varying resource demands. Employ your advanced experience to conduct an in-depth analysis of the manifest and propose optimizations for enhanced performance, cost-efficiency, and fault tolerance. Assume the manifest is not directly accessible; provide detailed code snippets to showcase your modifications and optimizations.

Deliverables:
1. A comprehensive analysis of the hypothetical cluster's configuration and identified areas for improvement, considering microservices' resource demands.
2. Advanced code snippets demonstrating modifications and optimizations to the cluster configuration.
3. A strategic plan outlining the optimization approach and reasoning for each modification

### Solution

Lets segregate the problem into two parts:
1.	K8s cluster optimisation
    - Performance enhancement    
    - Fault tolerance and scalability of the cluster
    - Cost optimisation
2.	Optimisation of the service deployed in K8s cluster
    - Performance enhancement
    - Fault tolerance, scalability and high availability of the services deployed in K8
    - Cost optimisation at service deployment level
