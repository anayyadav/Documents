# Advanced GitOps Workflow Design and Implementation:
Problem: Propose an intricate and advanced GitOps workflow for managing a sophisticated application deployment with multiple services and dependencies on Kubernetes. Assume a complex Git repository structure with placeholders for the application code, Helm Charts, and Kubernetes manifests. Leverage your advanced experience to craft a high-level, multistage GitOps workflow, and provide advanced code snippets to demonstrate how this workflow supports automatic application deployment upon changes to the repository.
Deliverables:
1. An elaborate and advanced description of the multistage GitOps workflow, detailing complex interactions and stages (without actual repository content).
2. Advanced code snippets illustrating how the proposed workflow supports continuous deployment in a complex application setup.
3. In-depth documentation explaining the advanced GitOps workflow, focusing on the intricacies demonstrated in your code snippets
